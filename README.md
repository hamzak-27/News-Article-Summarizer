# News-Article-Summarizer

This project involves building a News Articles Summarizer using Python and OpenAI's GPT model. The process begins with scraping news articles from the web using libraries like requests and newspaper3k to extract titles and texts from the articles. The text is then cleaned and preprocessed for input into ChatGPT. After preprocessing, ChatGPT generates concise summaries of the articles. The results are presented alongside the original titles, providing users with quick and clear summaries of the key points from each article
